# polynomial feature extraction for improved early predicitions in diabetes
diabetes prediction is the process where different alogorithms are apllied to predict persons with high chances having diabets 
using some clinical and demographic information
this prediction is important because patients diagnosed at the beginning stage they handle the disease in the why that will prevent the worsening of the condition 
this work aims to determaining the effect of polynomial feature extraction on efficiency of the several machine learning alogorithms used in early diabetes prediction
this purpose of work is to determain the if the feature extraction approach leads to the optimization of model performance and better identification of patients at high risk
tree based,boosting and naive bayes variants are implemented on a processed diabets
prediction dataset from kaggle using both the orginal and polynomial features 
the first stage of the research consists of comprehensive literature analysisof the impact of polynomial feature extraction in early stage diabets prediction using machine learning models
the data will be partitioned into testing and validation segments after the collection and purification process from the null values and duplicates and first step will involve pursuing varients of naive bayes, treebased and boosting  models using orginal charcteristics in th levelse data
gridsearchcv allows to find the optimal hyperparameters of each model.next created polynomial features are added into the data set
a variety of algorithms for machine learning were selected  for the project with their own unique strengths
representation of trees such as random forest and extra tress demonastrtes strong perfromance in adressing various releationship types and thrives on high dimensional
by using a group of dicision trees together random forest mitigates overfitting and raises accuracy
extra trees improves performance by randomly varying split points by gradually adding to weaker models gradient boost and adboost showcase effectiveness in enchanching accuracy by targeting earlier errors
