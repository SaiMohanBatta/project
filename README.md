# polynomial feature extraction for improved early predicitions in diabetes
diabetes prediction is the process where different alogorithms are apllied to predict persons with high chances having diabets 
using some clinical and demographic information
this prediction is important because patients diagnosed at the beginning stage they handle the disease in the why that will prevent the worsening of the condition 
this work aims to determaining the effect of polynomial feature extraction on efficiency of the several machine learning alogorithms used in early diabetes prediction
this purpose of work is to determain the if the feature extraction approach leads to the optimization of model performance and better identification of patients at high risk
tree based,boosting and naive bayes variants are implemented on a processed diabets
prediction dataset from kaggle using both the orginal and polynomial features 
the first stage of the research consists
